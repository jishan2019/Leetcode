# 138.Copy List with Random Pointer
# Linked list

# A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
#
# Return a deep copy of the list.
#
# The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:
#
# val: an integer representing Node.val
# random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
