    "You are given an integer array A.  From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps.  The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even numbered jumps.\n",

    "You may from index i jump forward to index j (with i < j) in the following way:\n",

    "During odd numbered jumps (ie. jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that A[i] <= A[j] and A[j] is the smallest possible value.  If there are multiple such indexes j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\n",

    "From starting index i = 0, we can jump to i = 2 (since A[2] is the smallest among A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4] that is greater or equal to A[0]), then we can't jump any more.\n",

    "During our 2nd jump (even numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because A[2] is the largest value in (A[2], A[3], A[4]) that is less than or equal to A[1].  A[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3.\n",

    "We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we notice that where you jump to is determined only by the state of your current index and the jump number parity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each state, there is exactly one state you could jump to (or you can't jump.) If we somehow knew these jumps, we could solve the problem by a simple traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the problem reduces to solving this question: for some index i during an odd numbered jump, what index do we jump to (if any)? The question for even-numbered jumps is similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's figure out where index i jumps to, assuming this is an odd-numbered jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider each value of A in order from smallest to largest. When we consider a value A[j] = v, we search the values we have already processed (which are <= v) from largest to smallest. If we find that we have already processed some value v0 = A[i] with i < j, then we know i jumps to j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naively this is a little slow, but we can speed this up with a common trick for harder problems: a monotonic stack. (For another example of this technique, please see the solution to this problem: (Article - Sum of Subarray Minimums))\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's store the indices i of the processed values v0 = A[i] in a stack, and maintain the invariant that this is monotone decreasing. When we add a new index j, we pop all the smaller indices i < j from the stack, which all jump to j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we know oddnext[i], the index where i jumps to if this is an odd numbered jump. Similarly, we know evennext[i]. We can use this information to quickly build out all reachable states using dynamic programming.\n",
