    "482. License Key Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Input: S = \"5F3Z-2e-9-w\", K = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: \"5F3Z-2E9W\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.\n",
    "Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "Input: S = \"2-5g-3-J\", K = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: \"2-5G-3J\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.\n",
    "String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and dashes(-).\n",
    "String S is non-empty."
